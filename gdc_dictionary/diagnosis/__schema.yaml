  # relationship to parent entity should be able to specify by using

  # Semantically there shouldn't be any difference, it's a matter of 
  # convenience. However, for clinical related schemas (case & diagnosis) it may
  # make more sense to use submitter's IDs, so that submitter can
  # fully specify and maintain the relationships on their own side.
  # For example, BCR should not need to know anything
  # about GDC assigned IDs (neither internal uuid nor short user-friendly ID)
  # However, for harmonization workflows, as the IDs are not usually
  # managed by user, system-generated IDs will need to be used for
  # specifying relationships
